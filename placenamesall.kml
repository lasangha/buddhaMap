				<description><![CDATA[The chief shrine at Āḷavī, originally a pagan place of worship, but later converted into a Buddhist <i>vihāra</i>. The Buddha stopped here on many occasions during his wanderings, and this was the scene of several Vinaya rules, e.g. against monks digging the ground <span class="ref">Vin.iv.32</span> and cutting trees, <span class="ref">Vin.iv.34</span> using unfiltered water for building purposes, <span class="ref">Vin.iv.48</span> sleeping in the company of novices, <span class="ref">Vin.iv.16</span> giving new buildings in hand. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.172<em>f.</em></span></p><p>The Chabbaggiyā are censured here for a <i>nissaggiya</i> offence. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.224</span> The Vaṅgīsa Sutta was preached there to Vaṅgīsa, on the occasion of the death of his preceptor, Nigrodhakappa. <span class="ref">Snp.59<em>f.</em></span> In the early years of Vaṅgīsa’s novitiate he stayed at the shrine with his preceptor, and disaffection arose within him twice, once because of women, the second time because of his tutor’s solitary habits, <span class="ref">SN.i.185–18​6</span> and later, again, through pride in his own powers of improvisation (<i>paṭibhāna</i>). <span class="ref">SN.i.187</span> Here, again, the Buddha utters the praises of Hatthaka Āḷavaka, who visits him with a large following, whose fealty has been won (according to Hatthaka) by observing the four characteristics of sympathy (<i>saṅgahavatthūni</i>) learnt from the Buddha. <span class="ref">AN.iv.216–2​20</span>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[One of the 16 Great Nations (Mahājanapadā), mentioned in the Pitakas. The countries mentioned are Aṅga, Māgadha, Kāsī, Kosala, Vajji, Mallā, Ceti, Vaṁsa, Kuru, Pañcāla, Macchā, Sūrasena, Assaka, Avantī, Gandhāra, and Kamboja. <span class="ref">AN.i.213</span><span class="ref">AN.iv.252</span><span class="ref">AN.iv.256</span><span class="ref">AN.iv.260</span><span class="ref">DN.ii.200</span></p><p>It was to the east of Māgadha, from which it was separated by the River Campā, and had as its capital city Campā. Another city mentioned is Assapūra. <span class="ref">MN.i.271</span></p><p>In the Buddha’s time the Aṅgarājā was just a wealthy nobleman, and he is mentioned merely as having granted a pension to a Brahmin. <span class="ref">MN.ii.163</span> The people of Aṅga and Māgadha are generally mentioned together, so we may gather that by the Buddha’s time they had become one people. They provide Uruvelā-Kassapa with offerings for his great sacrifice. <span class="ref">Vin.i.27</span></p><p>Several discourses were preached in the Aṅga country, among them being the Soṇadaṇḍa Sutta and the two Assapura Suttas. The Mahāgovinda Sutta seems to indicate that once, in the past, Dhataraṭṭha was king of Aṅga. But this, perhaps, refers to another country.</p><p> Soṇa Koḷivisa, before he entered the Order, was a squire (<i>paddhagu</i>) of Aṅga. <span class="ref">Thag.632</span>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[A banyan tree in Uruvelā, on the banks of the Nerañjara, near the Bodhi tree. A week after the Enlightenment the Buddha went there and spent a week cross-legged at the foot of the tree. There he met the Huhuṅkajātika Brahmin. <span class="ref">Vin.i.2–3</span> Two weeks later he went there again from the Rajāyatana. <span class="ref">Vin.i.4</span> It was then that the Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and persuaded him to preach the doctrine, in spite of the difficulty of the task. <span class="ref">Vin.i.5–7</span> When the Buddha wishes to have someone as his teacher, Sahampati appears again and suggests to him that the Dhamma be considered his teacher. <span class="ref">AN.ii.20<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">SN.i.138<em>f.</em></span></p><p>By Ajapāla-nigrodha it was, too, that, immediately after the Enlightenment, Māra tried to persuade the Buddha to die at once. <span class="ref">DN.ii.112</span> Several other conversations held here with Māra are recorded in the Saṁyutta. <span class="ref">SN.i.103<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Here, also, the Buddha spent some time before the Enlightenment. <span class="ref">DN.ii.267</span></p><p>The Brahmā Sutta <span class="ref">SN.v.167</span> and the Magga Sutta, <span class="ref">SN.v.185</span> both on the four satipaṭṭhāna, and another Brahmā Sutta <span class="ref">SN.v.232<em>f.</em></span> on the five <i>indriyāni</i>, were concerning thoughts that occurred to the Buddha on various occasions at the foot of this tree, when he sat there soon after the Enlightenment. On all these occasions Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and confirmed his thoughts. Several old brahmins, advanced in years, visited the Buddha during this period and questioned him as to whether it were true that he did not pay respect to age. To them he preached the four Thera-karaṇā dhamma. <span class="ref">AN.ii.22</span>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[A village in the Māgadha country, three gāvuta from Rājagaha. Between it and Rājagaha is the river Sappinī, which rises in the Gijjhakūṭa. <span class="ref">Vin.i.109</span> Once the Buddha went from Benares to Andhakavinda with 1,250 monks, and many people followed them carrying cartloads of provisions that they might feed them in turn. There were so many awaiting their turn that a certain brahmin (referred to as Andhakavindabrāhmana) had to wait two months for his to come round. At the end of two months, finding that his own affairs were going to ruin and that there was no likelihood of his turn coming soon, the brahmin went to the provision-room to see what deficiency he could possibly supply. Seeing there neither rice, milk, nor honey-lumps, he approached Ānanda, and having, through him, obtained the Buddha’s permission, the brahmin prepared a meal of milk-rice and honey-lumps for the Buddha and the monks. At the conclusion of the meal the Buddha spoke of the tenfold good qualities of milk-rice. <span class="ref">Vin.i.220<em>f.</em></span> It was this praise uttered by the Buddha that made Visākhā ask him, as a favour, that she should be allowed to supply milk-rice to the monks throughout her life. <span class="ref">Vin.i.293</span></p><p>During the same visit of the Buddha, a newly converted minister of the district prepared meat dishes for the fraternity, but being disappointed that the monks, who had had a meal of solid milk-rice earlier, could not eat large quantities of his dishes, he was rather rude to them. Later he expressed remorse, and the Buddha assured him that heaven would be his inheritance <span class="ref">Vin.i.222<em>f.</em></span> (This was the occasion for the rule that monks who have been invited to a meal in one place should not accept milk-rice somewhere else earlier in the same day.) It was on the way back from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha that the Buddha met Belaṭṭha Kaccāna. <span class="ref">Vin.i.224<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Once when the Buddha was staying at Andhakavinda the Brahmā Sahampati came and lighted the place with his effulgent beauty till late at night; then he sought the Buddha and sang before him verses of exhortation meant for the monks, urging them to lead the holy life. <span class="ref">SN.i.154</span> Here, too, the Buddha mentioned to Ānanda the necessity of admonishing and encouraging new members of the Order with regard to five things: good conduct, control of the faculties of sense, abstinence from too much talking, love of solitude and the cultivation of right views. <span class="ref">AN.iii.138–13​9</span>]]></description>

When the Buddha was on tour near there he was repeatedly warned by the cowherds not to go to Ambatiṭṭha as in the Jaṭila’s hermitage in the village dwelt a mighty Nāga. While the Buddha was yet in Bhaddavatikā the Elder Sāgata went to the Jaṭila’s hermitage and took up his abode near the fireplace. The Nāga showed his resentment, but Sāgata was able to overcome him by means of his <i>iddhi</i>-powers. Later Sāgata visited the Buddha at Bhaddavatikā and went with him to Kosambī. The fame of the Elder’s victory over the Nāga had preceded him and the inhabitants of Kosambī were lavish in their hospitality to him. He drank wine in their houses and had to be carried to see the Buddha. The latter made this the occasion for declaring the drinking of intoxicants to be a <i>pācittiya</i>-offence. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.108–1​10</span>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[One of the four great monarchies in the time of the Buddha, the other three being Māgadha, Kosala and Vaṁsa (or Vatsa).

But according to another account, <span class="ref">DN.ii.235</span> Māhissati is mentioned as having been, at least for some time, the capital of Avanti. It is quite likely that ancient Avanti was divided into two parts, the northern part having its capital at Ujjenī and the southern part (also called Avanti Dakkhiṇāpatha) at Māhissati (Māhismatī).</p><p>The King of Avanti was Pajjota, a man of violent temper <span class="ref">Vin.i.277</span> and therefore known as Caṇḍa Pajjota. He wished to conquer the neighbouring kingdom of Kosambī, of which Udena was king, but his plans did not work out as he had anticipated.</p><p>The kingdom of Assaka is invariably mentioned in connection with Avanti. Even in the Buddha’s life-time, Avanti became a centre of Buddhism. Among eminent monks and nuns who were either born or resided there, are to be foun.</p><ul><li> Mahā Kaccāna</li><li> Nanda Kumāraputta</li><li> Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa</li><li> Dhammapāla</li><li> Abhayarājakumāra</li><li> Isidatta and Isidāsī</li></ul><p>Mahā Kaccāna seems to have spent a good deal of his time in Avanti, dwelling in the city of Kuraraghara in the Papāta Pabbata. <span class="ref">SN.iii.9</span><span class="ref">SN.iii.12</span><span class="ref">SN.iv.115–16</span><span class="ref">AN.v.46</span> He experienced great difficulty in collecting ten monks, in order that Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa might receive the higher Ordination; in fact it was not until three years had elapsed that he succeeded. <span class="ref">Vin.i.195</span> Later, when Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa visited the Buddha at Sāvatthī, he conveyed to the Buddha Mahā Kaccāna’s request that special rules might be laid down for the convenience of the monks of Avanti Dakkhiṇāpatha and of other border countries. <span class="ref">Vin.i.197–198</span> The Buddha agreed, and among the rules so laid down were the following.</p><ol><li>The higher Ordination could be given with only four monks and a Vinayadhara. </li><li>Monks are allowed the use of shoes with thick linings (because in Avanti the soil is black on the surface, rough and trampled by cattle).</li><li>Monks are enjoined to bathe frequently.</li><li>Sheepskins, goatskins, etc., could be used as coverlets. </li><li>Robes could be accepted on behalf of a monk who has left the district, and the ten days’ rule with regard to such a gift will not begin until the robes have actually reached the monk’s hands. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.195–19​6</span> </li></ol><p>By the time of the Vesāli Council, however, Avanti had become one of the important centres of the orthodox school, for we find Yasa Kākandakaputta sending messengers to Avanti to call representatives to the Council, and we are told that eighty-eight arahants obeyed the summons. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.298–299</span></p><p>Even in the Buddha’s day there were rumours of the King of Avanti making preparations to attack Māgadha, but we are not told that he ever did so. <span class="ref">MN.iii.7</span> Subsequently, however, before the time of Candagupta, Avanti became incorporated with Māgadha.</p><p>Avanti is now identified with the country north of the Vindhaya Mountains and north-east of Bombay, roughly corresponding to modern Mālwa, Nimār and adjoining parts of the Central Provinces.]]></description>

At that time there dwelt in it a monk who had been ordained late in life and had formerly been a barber. He had two sons, handsome, elegant and well versed in the barber’s art. When the monk heard of the Buddha’s coming, he sent his sons from house to house to collect salt and oil and rice and meal. The young men, using all their powers of persuasion, collected a large quantity of each of these things, and when the Buddha arrived in Ātumā and went to stay in the Bhūsāgāra, they made ready rice-gruel and offered it to him. The Buddha, however, would not accept it as the monk, who had had the food collected, had been guilty of an unlawful act in that one monk had begged for others.</p><p>It was on this occasion that it was declared to be a <i>dukkaṭa</i> offence for a monk, who had formerly been a barber, to carry about with him a barber’s equipment. <span class="ref">Vin.i.249–250</span></p><p>In the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta <span class="ref">DN.ii.131–13​2</span> the Buddha tells Pukkusa of another occasion on which he was staying in the Bhūsāgāra in Ātumā.

But the Buddha had been in a state of concentration and had neither seen nor heard anything of it. Such was the state of calm of his mind.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[A city near the Himalaya, capital of the Sākiyan republic. The administration and judicial business of the city and all other matters of importance were discussed and decided in the Santhāgārasālā. <span class="ref">DN.i.91</span> The Buddha and his company lived in the Nigrodhārāma or the Mahāvana. When the Buddha returned a few years after his enlightenment, he met many of his family, and several of them ordained, including Nanda and Rāhula. <span class="ref">Vin.i.82</span><span class="ref">Vin.ii.180</span> </p><p>The Buddha certainly paid other visits besides these to Kapilavatthu. Various Sākyans went to see him both at the Nigrodhārāma and at the Mahāvana, among them being Mahānāma, <span class="ref">SN.v.369<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">AN.iii.284<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">AN.iv.220<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">AN.v.320<em>f.</em></span> Nandiya, <span class="ref">SN.v.403<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">SN.v.397<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">AN.v.334<em>f.</em></span> Vappa, <span class="ref">AN.ii.196</span><span class="ref">MN.i.91</span> and perhaps Sārakāni. <span class="ref">SN.v.372</span></p><p>During one visit the Buddha was entrusted with the consecration of a new mote-hall, built by the Sākyans; he preached far into the night in the new building, and, when weary, asked Moggallāna to carry on while he slept. On this occasion was preached the Sekha Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.i.353<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>The books record a visit paid by the Brahmā Sahampati to the Buddha in the Mahāvana at Kapilavatthu. The Buddha, worried by the noisy behavior of some monks who had recently been admitted into the Order, was wondering how he could impress on them the nature of their calling. Sahampati visited him and, being thus encouraged, the Buddha returned to Nigrodhārāma and there performed a miracle before the monks; seeing them impressed, he talked to them on the holy life. <span class="ref">SN.iii.91<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">Ud.25</span></p><p>A curious incident is related in connection with a visit paid by the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, when he went there after his rounds among the Kosalans. Mahānāma was asked to find a place of lodging for the night; he searched all through the town without success, and at length the Buddha was compelled to spend the night in the hermitage of Bharaṇḍu, the Kālāman. <span class="ref">AN.i.276<em>f.</em></span> On another occasion we hear of the Buddha convalescing at Kapilavatthu after an illness. <span class="ref">AN.i.219</span></p><p>Not all the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu believed in their kinsman’s great powers. We find, for instance, Daṇḍapāṇi meeting the Buddha in the Mahāvana and, leaning on his staff, questioning him as to his tenets and his gospel. We are told that in answer to the Buddha’s explanations, Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, waggled his tongue, and went away, still leaning on his staff, his brow puckered into three wrinkles. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.i.108<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Others were more convinced and patronised the Order—​​e.g., Kāla-Khemaka and Ghaṭāya, who built cells for monks in the Nigrodhārāma, as a result of noticing which the Buddha preached the Mahāsuññata Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.iii.109</span></p><p>Mahānāma was the Buddha’s most frequent visitor; to him was preached the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.i.91<em>f.</em></span></p><p>The Dakkhiṇā-vibhaṅga Sutta was preached as the result of a visit to the Buddha by Mahā-Pajāpatī-Gotamī. Apart from those already mentioned, another Sākyan lady lived in Kapilavatthu, Kāḷigodhā by name, and she was the only kinsman, with the exception of the Buddha’s father and wife, to be specially visited by the Buddha. <span class="ref">SN.v.396</span></p><p>The inhabitants of Kapilavatthu are called Kāpilavatthavā. <span class="ref">SN.iv.182</span></p><p>From Kapilavatthu lay a direct road to Vesālī, <span class="ref">Vin.ii.253</span> and through Kapilavatthu passed the road taken by Bāvarī’s disciples from Alaka to Sāvatthī. <span class="ref">Snp.p.194</span></p><p>It was not mentioned by Ānanda among the great cities, in one of which, in his opinion, the Buddha could more fittingly have died than in Kusinārā. <span class="ref">DN.ii.146</span> After the Buddha’s death, a portion of the relics was claimed by the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu, and a shrine to hold them was erected in the city. <span class="ref">DN.ii.167</span>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[One of the sixteen Great Nations, <span class="ref">AN.i.213</span> its capital being Bārāṇasī.</p><p>At the time of the Buddha, it had been absorbed into the kingdom of Kosala, and Pasenadi was king of both countries.<span class="ref">DN.i.288</span><span class="ref">MN.ii.111</span> The Vinaya, <span class="ref">Vin.i.28l</span> however, mentions a Kāsika-rājā who sent a robe to Jīvaka. Even at this time, however, the memory of Kāsi as an independent kingdom seems to have been still fresh in men’s minds. It is very frequently mentioned as such in the Jātakas and elsewhere. Kāsi was once ruled by the Bhāratas, one of whom, Dhataraṭṭha, was its king in the time of Reṇu. <span class="ref">DN.ii.235<em>f.</em></span> There seem to have been frequent wars between the countries of Kāsi and Kosala, victory belonging now to one, now to the other. In one such war, Dīghāti the Kosala king, was defeated by the king of Kāsi, but Dīghīti’s son Dīghāvu won back the kingdom. <span class="ref">Vin.i.334</span></p><p>The traditional name of the king of Kāsi from time immemorial was evidently Brahmadatta, and references to kings of that name abound in the Jātakas. Among other kings of Kāsi mentioned is Kikī . <span class="ref">MN.ii.49</span></p><p>Kāsi was evidently a great centre of trade and a most populous and prosperous country. Frequent mention is made of caravans leaving Kāsi to travel for trade. One highway went through Kāsi to Rājagaha <span class="ref">Vin.i.212</span> and another to Sāvatthī. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.10</span> Kāsi was famed for her silks, and Kāsi-robes were most highly esteemed as gifts. Mention is also made of the perfumes of Kāsi. <span class="ref">AN.iii.391</span></p><p>Besides those already referred to, other names of places mentioned in literature as belonging to Kāsi, are Vāsabhagāma, Macchikāsaṇḍa, Kīṭāgiri and Dhammapālagāma. Kāsi and Kosala are frequently mentioned together. <span class="ref">AN.v.59</span>. Kāsigāma or Kāsinigama was probably the actual name of the village in Kāsi which was given by Mahākosala to his daughter when she married Bimbisāra. The village produced a revenue of one hundred thousand, and was given to the queen for her bath and perfume money. After Bimbisāra’s death, Pasenadi withdrew the gift from Ajātasattu, which act was the cause of a war between the two. Later, when Pasenadi’s daughter Vajirā was married to Ajātasattu, the village was given back as part of her dowry. <span class="ref">SN.i.82<em>ff.</em></span>]]></description>

At that time it was a small city, “a branch-township with wattle-and-daub houses in the midst of the jungle,” and Ānanda was, at first, disappointed that the Buddha should have chosen it for his Parinibbāna. But the Buddha pointed out to him that in ancient times it had been Kusāvatī, the royal city of Mahā-Sudassana. <span class="ref">DN.ii.146<em>ff.</em></span> It was twelve leagues in length and twelve in breadth, prosperous and full of people, like Āḷakamandā. It was then at the head of eighty-four Towns. <span class="ref">SN.iii.144</span>. <span class="ref">DN.ii.170<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Between Kusinārā and Pāvā ​​lay the stream of Kakuttha on the banks of which was the Ambavana; beyond that was the Hiraññavatī river.</p><p>After the Buddha’s death his body was carried into the city by the northern gate and out of the city by the eastern gate; to the east of the city was Makuṭabandhana, the shrine of the Mallas, and there the body was cremated. For seven days those assembled at the ceremony held a festival in honour of the relics. <span class="ref">DN.ii.160<em>f.</em></span></p><p>As the scene of his death, Kusinārā became one of the four holy places declared by the Buddha to be fit places of pilgrimage for the pious, the other three being Kapilavatthu, Buddhagayā and Isipatana. <span class="ref">DN.ii.140</span> Mention is made of other visits paid to Kusinārā by the Buddha, prior to that when his death took place. Thus, once he went there from Āpaṇa and having spent some time at Kusinārā, proceeded to Ātumā. The Mallas of Kusinārā were always great admirers of the Buddha, even though not all of them were his followers, and on the occasion of this visit they decided that any inhabitant of Kusinārā who failed to go and meet the Buddha and escort him to the city, would be fined five hundred. It was on this occasion that Rojā the Mallan was converted and gave to the Buddha and the monks a supply of green vegetables and pastries. <span class="ref">Vin.i.247<em>f.</em></span> During some of these visits the Buddha stayed in a wood called Baliharana, and there he preached two of the Kusinārā Suttas <span class="ref">AN.i.274<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">AN.v.79<em>f.</em></span> and the “Kinti” Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.ii.238<em>f.</em></span> A third Kusinārā Sutta he preached while staying at Upavattana. <span class="ref">AN.ii.79</span><span class="ref">Ud.iv.2</span></p><p>The people of Kusinārā are called Kosinārakā. <span class="ref">DN.ii.167</span>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The capital of the Vatsas or Vaṁsas. In the time of the Buddha its king was Parantapa, and after him reigned his son Udena. Kosambī was evidently a city of great importance at the time of the Buddha for we find Ānanda mentioning it as one of the places suitable for the Buddha’s Parinibbāna.<span class="ref">DN.ii.146</span><span class="ref">DN.ii.169</span> It was also the most important halt for traffic coming to Kosala and Māgadha from the south and the west. <span class="ref">Vin.i.277</span></p><p>The usual route from Rājagaha to Kosambī was up the river. This was the route taken by Ānanda when he went with five hundred others to inflict the higher punishment on Channa, <span class="ref">Vin.ii.290</span> though there seems to have been a land route passing through Anupiya and Kosambī to Rājagaha. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.184<em>f.</em></span> In the Sutta Nipāta <span class="ref">Snp.1010–1013</span> the whole route is given from Mahissati to Rājagaha, passing through Kosambī, the halting-places mentioned being Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Vanasavhya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā, Bhoganagara and Vesāli.</p><p>Near Kosambī, by the river, was Udena’s park, the Udakavana, where Ānanda and Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja preached to the women of Udena’s palace on two different occasions. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.290<em>f.</em></span> The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Siṁsapāvana in Kosambī. <span class="ref">SN.v.437</span></p><p>Already in the Buddha’s time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosambī—​​the Kukkuṭārāma, the Ghositārāma, the Pāvārika-ambavana, and the Badarikārāma. The Buddha visited Kosambī on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books.</p><p>A great division once arose among the monks in Kosambī. Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be dismissed. The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong. The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged. The people of Kosambī, becoming angry at the monks’ behaviour, the quarrel grew apace. The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Dīghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference. In disgust the Buddha left Kosambī and, journeying through Bālakaloṇakāragāma and the Pācīnavaṁsadāya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Pārileyyaka forest. In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambī, and, coming to the Buddha at Sāvatthī, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute. <span class="ref">Vin.i.337–3​57</span> The story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in the Udāna <span class="ref">Ud.iv.5</span> and in the Saṁyutta, <span class="ref">SN.iii.94</span> but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambī uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics.</p><p>During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesāli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kākandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambī, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.298</span></p><p>It was at Kosambī that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.307</span></p><p>Kosambī is mentioned in the Saṁyutta Nikāya <span class="ref">SN.iv.179</span> as being on the Ganges, but here as elsewhere this simply means on a great river, in this case the Yamuna.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The name of a people and their country.</p><p>The country is included in the sixteen Great Nations of the Buddha’s time. The kingdom, at that time, was divided into two parts, having their respective capitals in Pāvā and Kusinārā. The Mallas of Pāvā were called Pāveyyakā Mallā, those of Kusināra, Kosinārakā. That these were separate kingdoms is shown by the fact that after the Buddha’s death at Kusināra, the Mallas of Pāvā sent messengers to claim their share of the Buddha’s relics. <span class="ref">DN.ii.165</span> Each had their Mote Hall.</p><p>In the Saṅgīti Sutta we are told that the Buddha, in the course of one of his journeys, came with five hundred followers to Pāvā and stayed in the Ambavana of Cunda the smith. A new Mote Hall, called Ubbhataka, had just been completed for the Mallas of Pāvā, and the Buddha was invited to be the first to occupy it that it might be consecrated thereby. The Buddha accepted the invitation, and preached in the Hall far into the night. It was also at Pāvā that the Buddha took his last meal, of Sūkaramaddava, at the house of Cunda. <span class="ref">DN.ii.126<em>f.</em></span> From there he went to Kusinārā, and there, as he lay dying, he sent Ānanda to the Mallas of Kusināra, who were assembled in their Mote Hall to announce his approaching death. The Mallas thereupon came to the Upavattana Sāla grove where the Buddha was, in order to pay him their last respects. Ānanda made them stand in groups according to family, and then presented them to the Buddha, announcing the name of each family. After the Buddha’s death, they met together once more in the Mote Hall, and made arrangements to pay him all the honour due to a Cakkavatti. They cremated the Buddha’s body at the Makuṭabandhana cetiya, and then collected the relics, which they deposited in their Mote Hall, surrounding them with a lattice work of spears and a rampart of bows till they were distributed among the various claimants by Doṇa. <span class="ref">DN.ii.166</span> The Mallas, both of Pāvā and Kusināra, erected thūpas over their respective shares of the relics and held feasts in their honour. <span class="ref">DN.ii.167</span></p><p>The Malla capital of Kusinārā was, in the Buddha’s day, a place of small importance. Ānanda contemptuously refers to it as a “little wattle and daub town in the midst of a jungle, a branch township,” quite unworthy of being the scene of the Buddha’s Parinibbāna. But the Buddha informs Ānanda that it was once Kusāvatī, the mighty capital of Kusa and Mahāsudassana. They were regarded, together with the Vajjis, as a typical example of a republic. <span class="ref">MN.i.231</span> The chief Mallas administered the state in turn.</p><p>Both the Buddha and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta appear to have had followers among the Mallas. Pāvā was the scene of Nāṭaputta’s death, just as Kusinārā was of the Buddha’s. Several followers of the Buddha among the Mallas are mentioned by name—​​e.g., Dabba, Pukkusa, Khaṇḍasumana, Bhadragaka, Rāsiya, Rojā and Sīha.</p><p>Other places in the Malla country, besides Pāvā and Kusinārā, are mentioned where the Buddha stayed—​​e.g., Bhoganagara, Anupiya and Uruvelakappa, near which was the Mahāvana, a wide tract of forest.]]></description>

				<name>Māgadha</name>
				<description><![CDATA[One of the four chief kingdoms of India at the time of the Buddha, the others being Kosala, the kingdom of the Vaṁsas and Avanti. Māgadha formed one of the sixteen Mahājanapadas and had its capital at Rājagaha or Giribbaja where Bimbisāra, and after him Ajātasattu, reigned. Later, Pāṭaliputta became the capital. By the time of Bimbisāra, Aṅga, too, formed a part of Māgadha, and he was known as king of Aṅga Māgadha. Thus Bimbisāra sends for Soṇa Koḷivisa, a prominent citizen of Campā, capital of Aṅga. <span class="ref">Vin.i.27</span> In the Buddha’s day, Māgadha consisted of eighty thousand villages. <span class="ref">Vin.i.179</span></p><p>Ajātasattu succeeded in annexing Kosala with the help of the Licchavis, and he succeeded also in bringing the confederation of the latter under his sway; preliminaries to this struggle are mentioned in the books. <span class="ref">DN.ii.73<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">DN.ii.86</span></p><p>At the time of the Buddha, the kingdom of Māgadha was bounded on the east by the river Campā, on the south by the Vindhyā Mountains, on the west by the river Soṇa, and on the north by the Ganges. The latter river formed the boundary between Māgadha and the republican country of the Licchavis, and both the Māgadhas and the Licchavis evidently had equal rights over the river.</p><p>During the early Buddhist period Māgadha was an important political and commercial centre, and was visited by people from all parts of Northern India in search of commerce and of learning. The kings of Māgadha maintained friendly relations with their neighbours, Bimbisāra and Pasenadi marrying each other’s sisters. When Candappajjota of Ujjeni was suffering from jaundice, Bimbisāra sent him his own personal physician, Jīvaka.</p><p>In Māgadha was the real birth of Buddhism (see, e.g., the words put in the mouth of Sahampati: <i>pātur ahosi Magadhesu pubbe dhammo</i> <span class="ref">Vin.i.5</span> ), and it was from Māgadha that it spread after the Third Council. The Buddha’s chief disciples, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, came from Māgadha. The cornfields of Māgadha were rich and fertile. <span class="ref">Thag.208</span></p><p>The names of several places in Māgadha occur in the books—​​e.g., Ekanālā, NāIakagāma, Senānigama, Khāṇumata, Andhakavindha, Macala, Matula, Ambalaṭṭhikā, Pāṭaligāma, NāIandā and SāIindiya.</p><p>Māgadha is identified with the modern South Behar.]]></description>

It is said that, one day, when Visākhā had gone to the monastery to hear the Dhamma and afterwards attend on the sick monks and novices, she left in the preaching hall her jewellery and her servant girl forgot to remove it. Later, on going to fetch it, she found that Ānanda had put it away, and Visākhā, being told of this, decided not to wear it again. She had it valued by goldsmiths, who declared that it was worth nine crores and one hundred thousand. She had the ornament put in a cart and sent round for sāle. But there was none in Sāvatthī rich enough to buy it, and Visākhā herself bought it back. With the money thus obtained she built the Migāramātupāsāda at the Buddha’s suggestion. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.161<em>f.</em></span> Moggallāna was left to supervise the work with five hundred other monks.

				<description><![CDATA[A city, the capital of Māgadha.</p><p>The place was called Giribbaja (mountain stronghold) because it was surrounded by five hills—​​Paṇḍava, Gijjhakūṭa, Vebhāra, Isigili and Vepulla. It is said <span class="ref">MN.iii.68</span> that these hills, with the exception of Isigili, were once known by other names e.g., Vaṅkaka for Vepulla. <span class="ref">SN.ii.191</span> The Saṁyutta <span class="ref">SN.i.206</span> mentions another peak near Rājagaha—​​Indakūta.</p><p>Rājagaha was closely associated with the Buddha’s work. He visited it soon after the Renunciation. Bimbisāra saw him begging in the street, and questioned him as to his purpose. <span class="ref">Snp.472–491</span> During the first year after the Enlightenment the Buddha went to Rājagaha from Gayā, after the conversion of the Tebhātika Jatilas. Bimbisāra and his subjects gave the Buddha a great welcome, and the king entertained him and a large following of monks in the palace. It is said that on the day of the Buddha’s entry into the royal quarters, Sakka led the procession, in the guise of a young man, singing songs of praise of the Buddha. <span class="ref">Vin.i.35<em>ff.</em></span> Large numbers of householders joined the Order, and people blamed the Buddha for breaking up their families. But their censure lasted for only seven days. Among those ordained were the Sattarasavaggiyā with Upāli at their head.</p><p>The Buddha spent his first vassa in Rājagaha and remained there during the winter and the following summer. The people grew tired of seeing the monks everywhere, and, on coming to know of their displeasure, the Buddha went first to Dakkhiṇāgiri and then to Kapilavatthu. <span class="ref">Vin.i.77<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>Later the Buddha made Sāvatthī his headquarters, though he seems frequently to have visited and stayed at Rājagaha. It thus became the scene of several important suttas—​​e.g., the Āṭānāṭiya, Udumbarika and Kassapasīhanāda, Jīvaka, Mahāsakuladāyī, and Sakkapañha.</p><p>Many of the Vinaya rules were enacted at Rājagaha. Just before his death, the Buddha paid a last visit there. At that time, Ajātasattu was contemplating an attack on the Vajjians, and sent his minister, Vassakāra, to the Buddha at Gijjhakūṭa, to find out what his chances of success were. <span class="ref">DN.ii.72</span></p><p>After the Buddha’s death, Rājagaha was chosen by the monks, with Mahā Kassapa at their head, as the meeting place of the First Convocation. This took place at the Sattapaṇṇiguhā, and Ajātasattu extended to the undertaking his whole hearted patronage. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.285</span> The king also erected at Rājagaha a cairn over the relics of the Buddha, which he had obtained as his share. <span class="ref">DN.ii.166</span></p><p>Rājagaha was one of the six chief cities of the Buddha’s time, and as such, various important trade routes passed through it. The others cities were Campā, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī and Benares. <span class="ref">DN.ii.147</span></p><p>The Parāyana Vagga <span class="ref">Snp.1011–101​3</span> mentions a long and circuitous route, taken by Bāvarī’s disciples in going from Patiṭṭhāna to Rājagaha, passing through Māhissati, Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa. Vanasavhaya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, on to Rājagaha, by way of the usual places. The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta <span class="ref">DN.ii.72<em>ff.</em></span> gives a list of the places at which the Buddha stopped during his last journey along that road—​​Ambalaṭṭhikā, Nāḷandā, Pāṭaligāma, Koṭigāma, Nādikā, Vesāli, Bhaṇḍagāma, Hatthigāma, Ambagāma, Jambugāma, Bhoganagara, Pāvā, and the Kakuttha River, beyond which lay the Mango grove and the Sāla grove of the Mallas.</p><p>The books mention various places besides Veḷuvana, with its Kalandaka-nivāpa <i>vihāra</i> in and around Rājagaha—​​e.g., Sītavana, Jīvaka’s Ambavana, Pipphaliguhā, Udumbarikārāma, Moranivāpa with its Paribbājakārāma, Tapodārāma, Indasālaguhā in Vediyagiri, Sattapaṇṇiguhā, Latthivana, Maddakucchi, Supatiṭṭhacetiya, Pāsānakacetiya, Sappasoṇḍikapabbhāra and the pond Sumāgadhā.</p><p>The city gates were closed every evening, and after that it was impossible to enter the city. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.116<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Ajātasattu was afraid of invasion by the Licchavis, and Vassakāra is mentioned as having strengthened its fortifications. To the north east of the city was the brahmin village of Ambasaṇḍā <span class="ref">DN.ii.263</span> ; other villages are mentioned in the neighborhood, such as Kīṭāgiri, Upatissagāma, Kolitagāma, Andhakavinda, Sakkhara and Codanāvatthu.]]></description>

In one passage <span class="ref">AN.iii.76</span> the Licchavi, Mahānāma, seeing that a band of young Licchavis who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, is represented as saying, “These Licchavis will yet become Vajjians”.</p><p> Vesāli was the capital of the Licchavis and Mithilā of the Videhas. In the time of the Buddha, both Vesāli and Mithilā were republics, though Mithilā had earlier been a kingdom under Janaka.</p><p>In the time of the Buddha, and even up to his death, the Vajjians were a very prosperous and happy community. The Buddha attributed this to the fact that they practiced the seven conditions of welfare taught to them by himself in the Sārandada Cetiya.</p><p>The Buddha travelled several times through the Vajjian country, the usual route being through Kosala, Malla, Vajji, Kāsi, Māgadha, and thus back, <span class="ref">SN.v.348</span> and he preached to the people, mostly in the Kūṭāgārasālā in Vesāli. Among other places besides Vesāli visited by the Buddha, are mentioned Ukkacela, Koṭigāma, Nādikā, Beluvagāma, Bhaṇḍagāma, Bhogagāma and Hatthigāma.

				<description><![CDATA[A town in which the Buddha once spent the rainy season at the invitation of the brahmin Verañja. Verañja visits the Buddha at the foot of the Naḷerupucimanda, where he is staying, and asks him a series of questions, the first of which is: whether it be true that the Buddha pays no respect to aged brahmins. The Buddha replies that he has not seen a brahmin in the whole world to whom such respect is due from him. If the Tathāgata were so to honour anyone, that person’s head would split in pieces. Other questions follow on the Buddha’s doctrine and practices. The Buddha concludes by giving an account of his attainment of the threefold knowledge. The interview ends with the conversion of Verañja and his invitation to the Buddha to spend his rainy season there.</p><p>At that time there was a famine, and five hundred householders of Uttarāpatha, staying at Verañjā, supplied the monks with food. Moggallāna proposed to get food by the exercise of his magic power or by going with the monks to Uttarakuru, but he was dissuaded by the Buddha. During this stay Sāriputta received from the Buddha an explanation as to why the religious systems of the three previous Buddhas lasted so long, while those of the three preceding them—​​Vipassī, Sikhī and Vesabhū—​​did not.</p><p>At the conclusion of the vassa, the Buddha wished to take leave of Verañja before setting out, as was the custom of Buddhas when they received hospitality. Verañja admitted that, though he had invited the Buddha, he had not kept his promise, and this was due to his having too many duties in the house.</p><p>He invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal the next day, and, at the end of the meal, presented a set of three robes to the Buddha and a pair to each of the monks.</p><p>After leaving Verañjā the Buddha went to Benares, passing through Soreyya, Saṅkassa and Kaṇṇakujja, and crossing the Ganges at Payāgapatiṭṭhāna. From Benares he proceeded to Vesāli. This account, of the Buddha’s visit to Verañjā, forms the introduction to the Vinaya. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.1–11</span> The interview with Verañja is given in the Aṅguttara. <span class="ref">AN.iv.172<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>A road led from Verañjā to Madhurā, and the Aṅguttara Nikāya <span class="ref">AN.ii.57<em>f.</em></span> contains a sermon preached by the Buddha to a large number of people while he rested by the roadside. There was evidently frequent intercourse between Sāvatthī and Verañjā, and the Verañjaka Sutta was preached to some brahmins who visited the Buddha at Sāvatthī, whither they had gone on business. The books also record <span class="ref">AN.iv.198<em>f.</em></span> a visit paid by the Asura Pahārāda to the Buddha at Verañjā.]]></description>

When the Buddha first visited Rājagaha, after his Enlightenment, he stayed at the Latthivanuyyāna. <span class="ref">Vin.i.35</span> The day after his arrival, he accepted the king’s invitation to a meal at the palace, at the end of which the king, seeking a place for the Buddha to live “not too far from the town, not too near, suitable for coming and going, easily accessible to all people, by day not too crowded, by night not exposed to noise and clamour, clean of the smell of people, hidden from men and well fitted to seclusion” decided on Veḷuvana, and bestowed it on the Buddha and the fraternity. This was the first monastery accepted by the Buddha, and a rule was passed allowing monks to accept such a monastery. <span class="ref">Vin.i.39<em>f.</em></span></p><p>The Buddha at once went to stay there, and it was during this stay that Sāriputta and Moggallāna joined the Order. <span class="ref">Vin.i.42</span></p><p>Kalaṇḍakanivāpa is the place nearly always mentioned as the spot where the Buddha stayed in Veḷuvana.

				<description><![CDATA[A city, capital of the Licchavis. It is not possible to know how many visits were paid by the Buddha to Vesāli, but the books would lead us to infer that they were several. Various Vinaya rules are mentioned as having been laid down at Vesāli. <span class="ref">Vin.i.238</span><span class="ref">Vin.i.287<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">Vin.ii.118</span><span class="ref">Vin.ii.119–127</span></p><p>It was during a stay in Vesāli, whither he had gone from Kapilavatthu, that Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī followed the Buddha with five hundred other Sākyan women, and, with the help of Ānanda’s intervention, obtained permission for women to enter the Order. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.253<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>The books describe <span class="ref">DN.ii.95<em>ff.</em></span> at some length the Buddha’s last visit to Vesāli on his way to Kusinārā. On the last day of this visit, after his meal, he went with Ānanda to Cāpāla cetiya for his siesta, and, in the course of their conversation, he spoke to Ānanda of the beauties of Vesāli: of the Udena cetiya, the Gotamaka cetiya, the Sattambaka cetiya, the Bahuputta cetiya, and the Sārandada cetiya. Other monasteries are also mentioned, in or near Vesāli e.g., Pātikārāma, Vālikārāma.</p><p>The Buddha generally stayed at the Kūṭāgārasālā during his visits to Vesāli, but it appears that he sometimes lived at these different shrines. <span class="ref">DN.ii.118</span> During his last visit to the Cāpāla cetiya he decided to die within three months, and informed Māra and, later, Ānanda, of his decision. The next day he left Vesāli for Bhaṇḍagāma, after taking one last look at the city, “turning his whole body round, like an elephant”. <span class="ref">DN.ii.122</span> The rainy season which preceded this, the Buddha spent at Beluvagāma, a suburb of Vesāli, while the monks stayed in and around Vesāli. On the day before he entered into the vassa, Ambapāli invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal, at the conclusion of which she gave her Ambavana for the use of the Order. <span class="ref">DN.ii.98</span></p><p>Among eminent followers of the Buddha who lived in Vesāli, special mention is made of Ugga, Piṅgiyāni, Kāraṇapālī, Sīha, Vāseṭṭha, <span class="ref">AN.iv.258</span> and the various Licchavis.</p><p>Vesāli was a stronghold of the Nigaṇṭhas. The Buddha’s presence in Vesāli was a source of discomfort to the Nigaṇṭhas, and we find mention of various devices resorted to by them to prevent their followers from coming under the influence of the Buddha.</p><p>At the time of the Buddha, Vesāli was a very large city, rich and prosperous, crowded with people and with abundant food. Its courtesan, Ambapālī, was famous for her beauty, and helped in large measure in making the city prosperous. <span class="ref">Vin.i.268</span></p><p>Outside the town was the Mahāvana, a large, natural forest. Near by were other forests, such as Gosiṅgalasāla. <span class="ref">AN.v.134</span></p><p>Among important suttas preached at Vesāli are the Mahāli, Mahāsīhanāda, Cūḷa Saccaka, Mahā Saccaka, Tevijja, Vacchagotta, Sunakkhatta and Ratana.</p><p>One hundred years after the Buddha’s death Vesāli was again the scene of interest for Buddhists, on account of the “Ten Points” raised by the Vajjiputtaka, and the second Council held in connection with this dispute at the Vālikārāma.</p><p>There were Nāgas living in Vesāli; these were called Vesālā. <span class="ref">DN.ii.258</span>]]></description>

His wife had suffered for seven years from a disease of the head, and even skilled physicians failed to cure her. Jīvaka, on his way to Rājagaha, after finishing his studies in Takkasilā, visited Sāketa, heard of her illness, and offered to cure her. At first the seṭṭhi was sceptic, but in the end allowed Jīvaka to attend on his wife. Jīvaka cured her by the administration of ghee through the nose, and, as reward, received sixteen thousand <i>kahāpanas</i> from her and her various kinsmen.]]></description>
