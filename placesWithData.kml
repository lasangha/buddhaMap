				<description><![CDATA[One of the 16 Great Nations (Mahājanapadā), mentioned in the Pitakas. The countries mentioned are Aṅga, Māgadha, Kāsī, Kosala, Vajji, Mallā, Ceti, Vaṁsa, Kuru, Pañcāla, Macchā, Sūrasena, Assaka, Avantī, Gandhāra, and Kamboja. <span class="ref">AN.i.213</span><span class="ref">AN.iv.252</span><span class="ref">AN.iv.256</span><span class="ref">AN.iv.260</span><span class="ref">DN.ii.200</span></p><p>It was to the east of Māgadha, from which it was separated by the River Campā, and had as its capital city Campā. Another city mentioned is Assapūra. <span class="ref">MN.i.271</span></p><p>In the Buddha’s time the Aṅgarājā was just a wealthy nobleman, and he is mentioned merely as having granted a pension to a Brahmin. <span class="ref">MN.ii.163</span> The people of Aṅga and Māgadha are generally mentioned together, so we may gather that by the Buddha’s time they had become one people. They provide Uruvelā-Kassapa with offerings for his great sacrifice. <span class="ref">Vin.i.27</span></p><p>Several discourses were preached in the Aṅga country, among them being the Soṇadaṇḍa Sutta and the two Assapura Suttas. The Mahāgovinda Sutta seems to indicate that once, in the past, Dhataraṭṭha was king of Aṅga. But this, perhaps, refers to another country.</p><p> Soṇa Koḷivisa, before he entered the Order, was a squire (<i>paddhagu</i>) of Aṅga. <span class="ref">Thag.632</span>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[A banyan tree in Uruvelā, on the banks of the Nerañjara, near the Bodhi tree. A week after the Enlightenment the Buddha went there and spent a week cross-legged at the foot of the tree. There he met the Huhuṅkajātika Brahmin. <span class="ref">Vin.i.2–3</span> Two weeks later he went there again from the Rajāyatana. <span class="ref">Vin.i.4</span> It was then that the Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and persuaded him to preach the doctrine, in spite of the difficulty of the task. <span class="ref">Vin.i.5–7</span> When the Buddha wishes to have someone as his teacher, Sahampati appears again and suggests to him that the Dhamma be considered his teacher. <span class="ref">AN.ii.20<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">SN.i.138<em>f.</em></span></p><p>By Ajapāla-nigrodha it was, too, that, immediately after the Enlightenment, Māra tried to persuade the Buddha to die at once. <span class="ref">DN.ii.112</span> Several other conversations held here with Māra are recorded in the Saṁyutta. <span class="ref">SN.i.103<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Here, also, the Buddha spent some time before the Enlightenment. <span class="ref">DN.ii.267</span></p><p>The Brahmā Sutta <span class="ref">SN.v.167</span> and the Magga Sutta, <span class="ref">SN.v.185</span> both on the four satipaṭṭhāna, and another Brahmā Sutta <span class="ref">SN.v.232<em>f.</em></span> on the five <i>indriyāni</i>, were concerning thoughts that occurred to the Buddha on various occasions at the foot of this tree, when he sat there soon after the Enlightenment. On all these occasions Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and confirmed his thoughts. Several old brahmins, advanced in years, visited the Buddha during this period and questioned him as to whether it were true that he did not pay respect to age. To them he preached the four Thera-karaṇā dhamma. <span class="ref">AN.ii.22</span>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The grove presented by Ambapālī to the Buddha and the Order. It was in Vesāli and was given to the Buddha during his last tour in that town, at the conclusion of the meal to which Ambapālī had invited him. <span class="ref">Vin.i.231–23​3</span> But both the Buddha and the monks seem to have stayed there previously during their visits to Vesāli. <span class="ref">DN.ii.94</span><span class="ref">SN.v.301</span></p><p>The Buddha is stated to have preached three suttas in the grove, two of them being on the value of the <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>. <span class="ref">SN.v.141<em>ff.</em></span> In the third sutta <span class="ref">AN.iv.100–106</span> he dwells on the impermanence of all sankhāras and proceeds to describe the process by which the whole world will ultimately be destroyed by seven suns arising in the world and drying everything up. In this sutta appears also the story of the teacher Sunetta, who, even after becoming the Great Brahma, is yet subject to old age and death.</p><p>The Saṁyutta also records a conversation that took place between Anuruddha and Sāriputta during a stay in Ambapālivana. <span class="ref">SN.v.301</span>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[A royal park on the road between Rājagaha and Nāḷandā. It contained a royal rest-house in which the Buddha and members of the Order used to stay in the course of their journeying. It was on one such occasion that the Brahmajāla Sutta was preached. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.287</span><span class="ref">DN.i.1</span></p> <p>It was one of the spots in which the Buddha rested during his last tour, and we are told that while there he discoursed to a large number of monks. <span class="ref">DN.ii.81</span></p> <p>But the most famous of the Buddha’s sermons in Ambalaṭṭhikā seems to have been the Ambalaṭṭhikā-Rāhulovāda Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.i.414<em>ff.</em></span> From the context it appears as though Ambalaṭṭhikā was within walking distance from the Kalandakanivāpa in Rājagaha.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Two visits of the Buddha to this city are recorded in the Canon; on one occasion he preached the Phena Sutta <span class="ref">SN.iii.140<em>ff.</em></span> and on the other the Dārukkhandha Sutta, although the latter is said in some manuscripts to have taken place in Kosambī. <span class="ref">SN.iv.179<em>f.</em></span> In both these references the city is said to be on the Ganges; the town usually called Ayojjha (Ayodhyā) is, rather, on the Sarayū, adjacent to or an alternative name for Sāketa. However, in the Pali texts <i>gaṅgā</i> is sometimes used for any river, and that would seem to be the case here.]]></description>

				<name>Avanti</name>
				<description><![CDATA[One of the four great monarchies in the time of the Buddha, the other three being Māgadha, Kosala and Vaṁsa (or Vatsa). Avanti is also mentioned among the sixteen Great Nations. <span class="ref">AN.i.213</span><span class="ref">AN.iv.252</span><span class="ref">AN.iv.256</span><span class="ref">AN.iv.260</span></p><p>Its capital was Ujjenī. But according to another account, <span class="ref">DN.ii.235</span> Māhissati is mentioned as having been, at least for some time, the capital of Avanti. It is quite likely that ancient Avanti was divided into two parts, the northern part having its capital at Ujjenī and the southern part (also called Avanti Dakkhiṇāpatha) at Māhissati (Māhismatī).</p><p>The King of Avanti was Pajjota, a man of violent temper <span class="ref">Vin.i.277</span> and therefore known as Caṇḍa Pajjota. He wished to conquer the neighbouring kingdom of Kosambī, of which Udena was king, but his plans did not work out as he had anticipated.</p><p>The kingdom of Assaka is invariably mentioned in connection with Avanti. Even in the Buddha’s life-time, Avanti became a centre of Buddhism. Among eminent monks and nuns who were either born or resided there, are to be foun.</p><ul><li> Mahā Kaccāna</li><li> Nanda Kumāraputta</li><li> Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa</li><li> Dhammapāla</li><li> Abhayarājakumāra</li><li> Isidatta and Isidāsī</li></ul><p>Mahā Kaccāna seems to have spent a good deal of his time in Avanti, dwelling in the city of Kuraraghara in the Papāta Pabbata. <span class="ref">SN.iii.9</span><span class="ref">SN.iii.12</span><span class="ref">SN.iv.115–16</span><span class="ref">AN.v.46</span> He experienced great difficulty in collecting ten monks, in order that Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa might receive the higher Ordination; in fact it was not until three years had elapsed that he succeeded. <span class="ref">Vin.i.195</span> Later, when Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa visited the Buddha at Sāvatthī, he conveyed to the Buddha Mahā Kaccāna’s request that special rules might be laid down for the convenience of the monks of Avanti Dakkhiṇāpatha and of other border countries. <span class="ref">Vin.i.197–198</span> The Buddha agreed, and among the rules so laid down were the following.</p><ol><li>The higher Ordination could be given with only four monks and a Vinayadhara. </li><li>Monks are allowed the use of shoes with thick linings (because in Avanti the soil is black on the surface, rough and trampled by cattle).</li><li>Monks are enjoined to bathe frequently.</li><li>Sheepskins, goatskins, etc., could be used as coverlets. </li><li>Robes could be accepted on behalf of a monk who has left the district, and the ten days’ rule with regard to such a gift will not begin until the robes have actually reached the monk’s hands. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.195–19​6</span> </li></ol><p>By the time of the Vesāli Council, however, Avanti had become one of the important centres of the orthodox school, for we find Yasa Kākandakaputta sending messengers to Avanti to call representatives to the Council, and we are told that eighty-eight arahants obeyed the summons. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.298–299</span></p><p>Even in the Buddha’s day there were rumours of the King of Avanti making preparations to attack Māgadha, but we are not told that he ever did so. <span class="ref">MN.iii.7</span> Subsequently, however, before the time of Candagupta, Avanti became incorporated with Māgadha.</p><p>Avanti is now identified with the country north of the Vindhaya Mountains and north-east of Bombay, roughly corresponding to modern Mālwa, Nimār and adjoining parts of the Central Provinces.]]></description>

It is probable, in that case, that the Godāvarī settlement, in the Dakkhiṇāpatha, was a later colony.</p><p>In the time of King Reṇu, the Assaka king of Potana was Brahmadatta. <span class="ref">DN.ii.236</span>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[A town between Sāvatthī and Rājagaha. The Buddha goes from Sāvatthī to Kīṭāgiri, thence to Āḷavī, and finally, to Rājagaha. The Buddha, on several occasions, stayed at Āḷavī at the Aggālava shrine, which was near the town. The town later became famous as the residence of Āḷavaka Yakkha and of Hatthaka Āḷavaka. The Therī, Selā was born in Āḷavī and was therefore known as Aḷavikā. There was evidently a large community of monks at Āḷavī, some of whom seem to have chiefly occupied themselves with building vihāras for themselves.]]></description>

				<name>Iccānaṅgala / Icchānaṅkala</name>
				<description><![CDATA[A brahmin village in the Kosala country. It was while staying in the woodland thicket there that the Buddha preached the Ambaṭṭha Sutta. <span class="ref">DN.i.87</span> From this sutta, the village would seem to have been near Pokkharasādi’s domain of Ukkaṭṭha. It was the residence of “Mahāsāla” brahmins. The Sutta Nipāta <span class="ref">Snp.p.115</span> mentions several eminent brahmins who lived there, among them Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkarasāti, Jāṇussoṇi and Todeyya.</p><p>There were also two learned youths, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja at Icchānaṅkala, who, finding it impossible to bring their discussion to a conclusion, sought the Buddha, then staying in the village. Their interview with the Buddha is recorded in the Vāseṭṭha Sutta <span class="ref">Snp.p.115<em>ff.</em></span><span class="ref">MN.ii.146<em>ff.</em></span></p> <p>According to the Saṁyutta Nikāya, <span class="ref">SN.v.325</span> the Buddha once stayed for three months in the jungle thicket at Icchānaṅgala, in almost complete solitude, visited only by a single monk who brought him his food. But from the Aṅguttara Nikāya <span class="ref">AN.iii.30<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">AN.iii.341</span><span class="ref">AN.iv.340<em>ff.</em></span> it would appear that the Buddha was not left to enjoy the solitude which he desired, for we are told that the residents of Icchānaṅgala, having heard of the Buddha’s visit, came to him in large numbers and created a disturbance by their shouts. The Buddha had to send Nāgita, who was then his personal attendant, to curb the enthusiasm of his admirers.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[One of the five mountains round Rājagaha and one of the beauty-spots of the city. <span class="ref">DN.ii.116</span> There was, on one side of it, a black stone called the Kāḷasilā. This was a favourite haunt of the Buddha and the members of the Order. There Dabba Mallaputta is asked by monks to provide for them accommodation. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.76</span><span class="ref">Vin.iii.41</span></p><p>It was also the scene of the suicide of Godhika and Vakkali. <span class="ref">SN.i.121</span><span class="ref">SN.iii.121<em>f.</em></span></p><p>In the Cūḷa DukkhakKhaṇḍa Sutta it is said that a large number of Nigaṇṭhas lived at Kāḷasilā, never sitting down, undergoing paroxysms of acute pain and agony, following the teachings of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta. The Buddha questioned them as to their practises and preached to them the above-mentioned Sutta, which he afterwards repeated to Mahānāma. <span class="ref">MN.i.91<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>Once when the Buddha was dwelling at Kāḷasilā, he sang the praises of Rājagaha, giving Ānanda a chance, if he so desired, of asking him to live on for a kappa; but Ānanda did not take his opportunity. <span class="ref">DN.iii.116</span></p><p>The books refer to several other visits of the Buddha to Isigilapassa.

Men, observing this, said that the mountain swallowed up the sages and so it came by its name of Isigili (“Gullet of the Sages“).]]></description>

Once Māra came to him in the darkness of the night in the guise of a terrifying elephant, trying to frighten him. On another dark night when the rain was falling drop by drop, Māra came to the Buddha and assumed various wondrous shapes, beautiful and ugly. Another time Māra tried to fill the Buddha’s mind with doubt as to whether he had really broken away from all fetters and won complete Enlightenment. <span class="ref">SN.i.103<em>ff.</em></span> Seven years after the Buddha’s Renunciation, Māra made one more attempt to make the Buddha discontented with his lonely lot and it was then, when Māra had gone away discomfited, that Māra’s three daughters, Taṇhā, Ratī and Ragā, made a final effort to draw the Buddha away from his purpose. <span class="ref">SN.i.124<em>f.</em></span></p><p>It was at Uruvelā, too, that the Buddha had misgivings in his own mind as to the usefulness of preaching the Doctrine which he had realised, to a world blinded by passions and prejudices.

The administration and judicial business of the city and all other matters of importance were discussed and decided in the Santhāgārasālā. <span class="ref">DN.i.91</span> The Buddha and his company lived in the Nigrodhārāma or the Mahāvana. When the Buddha returned a few years after his enlightenment, he met many of his family, and several of them ordained, including Nanda and Rāhula. <span class="ref">Vin.i.82</span><span class="ref">Vin.ii.180</span> </p><p>The Buddha certainly paid other visits besides these to Kapilavatthu. Various Sākyans went to see him both at the Nigrodhārāma and at the Mahāvana, among them being Mahānāma, <span class="ref">SN.v.369<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">AN.iii.284<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">AN.iv.220<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">AN.v.320<em>f.</em></span> Nandiya, <span class="ref">SN.v.403<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">SN.v.397<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">AN.v.334<em>f.</em></span> Vappa, <span class="ref">AN.ii.196</span><span class="ref">MN.i.91</span> and perhaps Sārakāni. <span class="ref">SN.v.372</span></p><p>During one visit the Buddha was entrusted with the consecration of a new mote-hall, built by the Sākyans; he preached far into the night in the new building, and, when weary, asked Moggallāna to carry on while he slept. On this occasion was preached the Sekha Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.i.353<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>The books record a visit paid by the Brahmā Sahampati to the Buddha in the Mahāvana at Kapilavatthu. The Buddha, worried by the noisy behavior of some monks who had recently been admitted into the Order, was wondering how he could impress on them the nature of their calling. Sahampati visited him and, being thus encouraged, the Buddha returned to Nigrodhārāma and there performed a miracle before the monks; seeing them impressed, he talked to them on the holy life. <span class="ref">SN.iii.91<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">Ud.25</span></p><p>A curious incident is related in connection with a visit paid by the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, when he went there after his rounds among the Kosalans. Mahānāma was asked to find a place of lodging for the night; he searched all through the town without success, and at length the Buddha was compelled to spend the night in the hermitage of Bharaṇḍu, the Kālāman. <span class="ref">AN.i.276<em>f.</em></span> On another occasion we hear of the Buddha convalescing at Kapilavatthu after an illness. <span class="ref">AN.i.219</span></p><p>Not all the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu believed in their kinsman’s great powers. We find, for instance, Daṇḍapāṇi meeting the Buddha in the Mahāvana and, leaning on his staff, questioning him as to his tenets and his gospel. We are told that in answer to the Buddha’s explanations, Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, waggled his tongue, and went away, still leaning on his staff, his brow puckered into three wrinkles. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.i.108<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Others were more convinced and patronised the Order—​​e.g., Kāla-Khemaka and Ghaṭāya, who built cells for monks in the Nigrodhārāma, as a result of noticing which the Buddha preached the Mahāsuññata Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.iii.109</span></p><p>Mahānāma was the Buddha’s most frequent visitor; to him was preached the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.i.91<em>f.</em></span></p><p>The Dakkhiṇā-vibhaṅga Sutta was preached as the result of a visit to the Buddha by Mahā-Pajāpatī-Gotamī. Apart from those already mentioned, another Sākyan lady lived in Kapilavatthu, Kāḷigodhā by name, and she was the only kinsman, with the exception of the Buddha’s father and wife, to be specially visited by the Buddha. <span class="ref">SN.v.396</span></p><p>The inhabitants of Kapilavatthu are called Kāpilavatthavā. <span class="ref">SN.iv.182</span></p><p>From Kapilavatthu lay a direct road to Vesālī, <span class="ref">Vin.ii.253</span> and through Kapilavatthu passed the road taken by Bāvarī’s disciples from Alaka to Sāvatthī. <span class="ref">Snp.p.194</span></p><p>It was not mentioned by Ānanda among the great cities, in one of which, in his opinion, the Buddha could more fittingly have died than in Kusinārā. <span class="ref">DN.ii.146</span> After the Buddha’s death, a portion of the relics was claimed by the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu, and a shrine to hold them was erected in the city. <span class="ref">DN.ii.167</span>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[One of the sixteen Great Nations, <span class="ref">AN.i.213</span> its capital being Bārāṇasī.</p><p>At the time of the Buddha, it had been absorbed into the kingdom of Kosala, and Pasenadi was king of both countries.<span class="ref">DN.i.288</span><span class="ref">MN.ii.111</span> The Vinaya, <span class="ref">Vin.i.28l</span> however, mentions a Kāsika-rājā who sent a robe to Jīvaka. Even at this time, however, the memory of Kāsi as an independent kingdom seems to have been still fresh in men’s minds. It is very frequently mentioned as such in the Jātakas and elsewhere. Kāsi was once ruled by the Bhāratas, one of whom, Dhataraṭṭha, was its king in the time of Reṇu. <span class="ref">DN.ii.235<em>f.</em></span> There seem to have been frequent wars between the countries of Kāsi and Kosala, victory belonging now to one, now to the other. In one such war, Dīghāti the Kosala king, was defeated by the king of Kāsi, but Dīghīti’s son Dīghāvu won back the kingdom. <span class="ref">Vin.i.334</span></p><p>The traditional name of the king of Kāsi from time immemorial was evidently Brahmadatta, and references to kings of that name abound in the Jātakas. Among other kings of Kāsi mentioned is Kikī . <span class="ref">MN.ii.49</span></p><p>Kāsi was evidently a great centre of trade and a most populous and prosperous country. Frequent mention is made of caravans leaving Kāsi to travel for trade. One highway went through Kāsi to Rājagaha <span class="ref">Vin.i.212</span> and another to Sāvatthī. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.10</span> Kāsi was famed for her silks, and Kāsi-robes were most highly esteemed as gifts. Mention is also made of the perfumes of Kāsi. <span class="ref">AN.iii.391</span></p><p>Besides those already referred to, other names of places mentioned in literature as belonging to Kāsi, are Vāsabhagāma, Macchikāsaṇḍa, Kīṭāgiri and Dhammapālagāma. Kāsi and Kosala are frequently mentioned together. <span class="ref">AN.v.59</span>. Kāsigāma or Kāsinigama was probably the actual name of the village in Kāsi which was given by Mahākosala to his daughter when she married Bimbisāra. The village produced a revenue of one hundred thousand, and was given to the queen for her bath and perfume money. After Bimbisāra’s death, Pasenadi withdrew the gift from Ajātasattu, which act was the cause of a war between the two. Later, when Pasenadi’s daughter Vajirā was married to Ajātasattu, the village was given back as part of her dowry. <span class="ref">SN.i.82<em>ff.</em></span>]]></description>

At that time it was a small city, “a branch-township with wattle-and-daub houses in the midst of the jungle,” and Ānanda was, at first, disappointed that the Buddha should have chosen it for his Parinibbāna. But the Buddha pointed out to him that in ancient times it had been Kusāvatī, the royal city of Mahā-Sudassana. <span class="ref">DN.ii.146<em>ff.</em></span> It was twelve leagues in length and twelve in breadth, prosperous and full of people, like Āḷakamandā.

Thus, once he went there from Āpaṇa and having spent some time at Kusinārā, proceeded to Ātumā. The Mallas of Kusinārā were always great admirers of the Buddha, even though not all of them were his followers, and on the occasion of this visit they decided that any inhabitant of Kusinārā who failed to go and meet the Buddha and escort him to the city, would be fined five hundred. It was on this occasion that Rojā the Mallan was converted and gave to the Buddha and the monks a supply of green vegetables and pastries. <span class="ref">Vin.i.247<em>f.</em></span> During some of these visits the Buddha stayed in a wood called Baliharana, and there he preached two of the Kusinārā Suttas <span class="ref">AN.i.274<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">AN.v.79<em>f.</em></span> and the “Kinti” Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.ii.238<em>f.</em></span> A third Kusinārā Sutta he preached while staying at Upavattana. <span class="ref">AN.ii.79</span><span class="ref">Ud.iv.2</span></p><p>The people of Kusinārā are called Kosinārakā. <span class="ref">DN.ii.167</span>]]></description>

				<name>Kosambī</name>
				<description><![CDATA[The capital of the Vatsas or Vaṁsas. In the time of the Buddha its king was Parantapa, and after him reigned his son Udena. Kosambī was evidently a city of great importance at the time of the Buddha for we find Ānanda mentioning it as one of the places suitable for the Buddha’s Parinibbāna.<span class="ref">DN.ii.146</span><span class="ref">DN.ii.169</span> It was also the most important halt for traffic coming to Kosala and Māgadha from the south and the west. <span class="ref">Vin.i.277</span></p><p>The usual route from Rājagaha to Kosambī was up the river. This was the route taken by Ānanda when he went with five hundred others to inflict the higher punishment on Channa, <span class="ref">Vin.ii.290</span> though there seems to have been a land route passing through Anupiya and Kosambī to Rājagaha. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.184<em>f.</em></span> In the Sutta Nipāta <span class="ref">Snp.1010–1013</span> the whole route is given from Mahissati to Rājagaha, passing through Kosambī, the halting-places mentioned being Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Vanasavhya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā, Bhoganagara and Vesāli.</p><p>Near Kosambī, by the river, was Udena’s park, the Udakavana, where Ānanda and Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja preached to the women of Udena’s palace on two different occasions. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.290<em>f.</em></span> The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Siṁsapāvana in Kosambī. <span class="ref">SN.v.437</span></p><p>Already in the Buddha’s time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosambī—​​the Kukkuṭārāma, the Ghositārāma, the Pāvārika-ambavana, and the Badarikārāma. The Buddha visited Kosambī on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books.</p><p>A great division once arose among the monks in Kosambī. Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be dismissed. The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong. The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged. The people of Kosambī, becoming angry at the monks’ behaviour, the quarrel grew apace. The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Dīghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference. In disgust the Buddha left Kosambī and, journeying through Bālakaloṇakāragāma and the Pācīnavaṁsadāya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Pārileyyaka forest. In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambī, and, coming to the Buddha at Sāvatthī, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute. <span class="ref">Vin.i.337–3​57</span> The story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in the Udāna <span class="ref">Ud.iv.5</span> and in the Saṁyutta, <span class="ref">SN.iii.94</span> but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambī uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics.</p><p>During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesāli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kākandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambī, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.298</span></p><p>It was at Kosambī that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.307</span></p><p>Kosambī is mentioned in the Saṁyutta Nikāya <span class="ref">SN.iv.179</span> as being on the Ganges, but here as elsewhere this simply means on a great river, in this case the Yamuna.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The name of a people and their country.</p><p>The country is included in the sixteen Great Nations of the Buddha’s time. The kingdom, at that time, was divided into two parts, having their respective capitals in Pāvā and Kusinārā. The Mallas of Pāvā were called Pāveyyakā Mallā, those of Kusināra, Kosinārakā. That these were separate kingdoms is shown by the fact that after the Buddha’s death at Kusināra, the Mallas of Pāvā sent messengers to claim their share of the Buddha’s relics. <span class="ref">DN.ii.165</span> Each had their Mote Hall.</p><p>In the Saṅgīti Sutta we are told that the Buddha, in the course of one of his journeys, came with five hundred followers to Pāvā and stayed in the Ambavana of Cunda the smith. A new Mote Hall, called Ubbhataka, had just been completed for the Mallas of Pāvā, and the Buddha was invited to be the first to occupy it that it might be consecrated thereby. The Buddha accepted the invitation, and preached in the Hall far into the night. It was also at Pāvā that the Buddha took his last meal, of Sūkaramaddava, at the house of Cunda. <span class="ref">DN.ii.126<em>f.</em></span> From there he went to Kusinārā, and there, as he lay dying, he sent Ānanda to the Mallas of Kusināra, who were assembled in their Mote Hall to announce his approaching death. The Mallas thereupon came to the Upavattana Sāla grove where the Buddha was, in order to pay him their last respects. Ānanda made them stand in groups according to family, and then presented them to the Buddha, announcing the name of each family. After the Buddha’s death, they met together once more in the Mote Hall, and made arrangements to pay him all the honour due to a Cakkavatti. They cremated the Buddha’s body at the Makuṭabandhana cetiya, and then collected the relics, which they deposited in their Mote Hall, surrounding them with a lattice work of spears and a rampart of bows till they were distributed among the various claimants by Doṇa. <span class="ref">DN.ii.166</span> The Mallas, both of Pāvā and Kusināra, erected thūpas over their respective shares of the relics and held feasts in their honour. <span class="ref">DN.ii.167</span></p><p>The Malla capital of Kusinārā was, in the Buddha’s day, a place of small importance. Ānanda contemptuously refers to it as a “little wattle and daub town in the midst of a jungle, a branch township,” quite unworthy of being the scene of the Buddha’s Parinibbāna. But the Buddha informs Ānanda that it was once Kusāvatī, the mighty capital of Kusa and Mahāsudassana. They were regarded, together with the Vajjis, as a typical example of a republic. <span class="ref">MN.i.231</span> The chief Mallas administered the state in turn.</p><p>Both the Buddha and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta appear to have had followers among the Mallas. Pāvā was the scene of Nāṭaputta’s death, just as Kusinārā was of the Buddha’s. Several followers of the Buddha among the Mallas are mentioned by name—​​e.g., Dabba, Pukkusa, Khaṇḍasumana, Bhadragaka, Rāsiya, Rojā and Sīha.</p><p>Other places in the Malla country, besides Pāvā and Kusinārā, are mentioned where the Buddha stayed—​​e.g., Bhoganagara, Anupiya and Uruvelakappa, near which was the Mahāvana, a wide tract of forest.]]></description>

By the time of Bimbisāra, Aṅga, too, formed a part of Māgadha, and he was known as king of Aṅga Māgadha. Thus Bimbisāra sends for Soṇa Koḷivisa, a prominent citizen of Campā, capital of Aṅga. <span class="ref">Vin.i.27</span> In the Buddha’s day, Māgadha consisted of eighty thousand villages. <span class="ref">Vin.i.179</span></p><p>Ajātasattu succeeded in annexing Kosala with the help of the Licchavis, and he succeeded also in bringing the confederation of the latter under his sway; preliminaries to this struggle are mentioned in the books. <span class="ref">DN.ii.73<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">DN.ii.86</span></p><p>At the time of the Buddha, the kingdom of Māgadha was bounded on the east by the river Campā, on the south by the Vindhyā Mountains, on the west by the river Soṇa, and on the north by the Ganges. The latter river formed the boundary between Māgadha and the republican country of the Licchavis, and both the Māgadhas and the Licchavis evidently had equal rights over the river.</p><p>During the early Buddhist period Māgadha was an important political and commercial centre, and was visited by people from all parts of Northern India in search of commerce and of learning. The kings of Māgadha maintained friendly relations with their neighbours, Bimbisāra and Pasenadi marrying each other’s sisters. When Candappajjota of Ujjeni was suffering from jaundice, Bimbisāra sent him his own personal physician, Jīvaka.</p><p>In Māgadha was the real birth of Buddhism (see, e.g., the words put in the mouth of Sahampati: <i>pātur ahosi Magadhesu pubbe dhammo</i> <span class="ref">Vin.i.5</span> ), and it was from Māgadha that it spread after the Third Council. The Buddha’s chief disciples, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, came from Māgadha. The cornfields of Māgadha were rich and fertile. <span class="ref">Thag.208</span></p><p>The names of several places in Māgadha occur in the books—​​e.g., Ekanālā, NāIakagāma, Senānigama, Khāṇumata, Andhakavindha, Macala, Matula, Ambalaṭṭhikā, Pāṭaligāma, NāIandā and SāIindiya.</p><p>Māgadha is identified with the modern South Behar.]]></description>

				<name>Rājagaha</name>
				<description><![CDATA[A city, the capital of Māgadha.</p><p>The place was called Giribbaja (mountain stronghold) because it was surrounded by five hills—​​Paṇḍava, Gijjhakūṭa, Vebhāra, Isigili and Vepulla. It is said <span class="ref">MN.iii.68</span> that these hills, with the exception of Isigili, were once known by other names e.g., Vaṅkaka for Vepulla. <span class="ref">SN.ii.191</span> The Saṁyutta <span class="ref">SN.i.206</span> mentions another peak near Rājagaha—​​Indakūta.</p><p>Rājagaha was closely associated with the Buddha’s work. He visited it soon after the Renunciation. Bimbisāra saw him begging in the street, and questioned him as to his purpose. <span class="ref">Snp.472–491</span> During the first year after the Enlightenment the Buddha went to Rājagaha from Gayā, after the conversion of the Tebhātika Jatilas. Bimbisāra and his subjects gave the Buddha a great welcome, and the king entertained him and a large following of monks in the palace. It is said that on the day of the Buddha’s entry into the royal quarters, Sakka led the procession, in the guise of a young man, singing songs of praise of the Buddha. <span class="ref">Vin.i.35<em>ff.</em></span> Large numbers of householders joined the Order, and people blamed the Buddha for breaking up their families. But their censure lasted for only seven days. Among those ordained were the Sattarasavaggiyā with Upāli at their head.</p><p>The Buddha spent his first vassa in Rājagaha and remained there during the winter and the following summer. The people grew tired of seeing the monks everywhere, and, on coming to know of their displeasure, the Buddha went first to Dakkhiṇāgiri and then to Kapilavatthu. <span class="ref">Vin.i.77<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>Later the Buddha made Sāvatthī his headquarters, though he seems frequently to have visited and stayed at Rājagaha. It thus became the scene of several important suttas—​​e.g., the Āṭānāṭiya, Udumbarika and Kassapasīhanāda, Jīvaka, Mahāsakuladāyī, and Sakkapañha.</p><p>Many of the Vinaya rules were enacted at Rājagaha. Just before his death, the Buddha paid a last visit there. At that time, Ajātasattu was contemplating an attack on the Vajjians, and sent his minister, Vassakāra, to the Buddha at Gijjhakūṭa, to find out what his chances of success were. <span class="ref">DN.ii.72</span></p><p>After the Buddha’s death, Rājagaha was chosen by the monks, with Mahā Kassapa at their head, as the meeting place of the First Convocation. This took place at the Sattapaṇṇiguhā, and Ajātasattu extended to the undertaking his whole hearted patronage. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.285</span> The king also erected at Rājagaha a cairn over the relics of the Buddha, which he had obtained as his share. <span class="ref">DN.ii.166</span></p><p>Rājagaha was one of the six chief cities of the Buddha’s time, and as such, various important trade routes passed through it. The others cities were Campā, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī and Benares. <span class="ref">DN.ii.147</span></p><p>The Parāyana Vagga <span class="ref">Snp.1011–101​3</span> mentions a long and circuitous route, taken by Bāvarī’s disciples in going from Patiṭṭhāna to Rājagaha, passing through Māhissati, Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa. Vanasavhaya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, on to Rājagaha, by way of the usual places. The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta <span class="ref">DN.ii.72<em>ff.</em></span> gives a list of the places at which the Buddha stopped during his last journey along that road—​​Ambalaṭṭhikā, Nāḷandā, Pāṭaligāma, Koṭigāma, Nādikā, Vesāli, Bhaṇḍagāma, Hatthigāma, Ambagāma, Jambugāma, Bhoganagara, Pāvā, and the Kakuttha River, beyond which lay the Mango grove and the Sāla grove of the Mallas.</p><p>The books mention various places besides Veḷuvana, with its Kalandaka-nivāpa <i>vihāra</i> in and around Rājagaha—​​e.g., Sītavana, Jīvaka’s Ambavana, Pipphaliguhā, Udumbarikārāma, Moranivāpa with its Paribbājakārāma, Tapodārāma, Indasālaguhā in Vediyagiri, Sattapaṇṇiguhā, Latthivana, Maddakucchi, Supatiṭṭhacetiya, Pāsānakacetiya, Sappasoṇḍikapabbhāra and the pond Sumāgadhā.</p><p>The city gates were closed every evening, and after that it was impossible to enter the city. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.116<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Ajātasattu was afraid of invasion by the Licchavis, and Vassakāra is mentioned as having strengthened its fortifications. To the north east of the city was the brahmin village of Ambasaṇḍā <span class="ref">DN.ii.263</span> ; other villages are mentioned in the neighborhood, such as Kīṭāgiri, Upatissagāma, Kolitagāma, Andhakavinda, Sakkhara and Codanāvatthu.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The name of a country and of its people. It was one of the sixteen Great Nations. The inhabitants appear to have consisted of several confederate clans of whom the Licchavī and the Videhā were the chief. The names Vajjī and Licchavī were often synonymous. In one passage <span class="ref">AN.iii.76</span> the Licchavi, Mahānāma, seeing that a band of young Licchavis who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, is represented as saying, “These Licchavis will yet become Vajjians”.</p><p> Vesāli was the capital of the Licchavis and Mithilā of the Videhas. In the time of the Buddha, both Vesāli and Mithilā were republics, though Mithilā had earlier been a kingdom under Janaka.</p><p>In the time of the Buddha, and even up to his death, the Vajjians were a very prosperous and happy community. The Buddha attributed this to the fact that they practiced the seven conditions of welfare taught to them by himself in the Sārandada Cetiya.</p><p>The Buddha travelled several times through the Vajjian country, the usual route being through Kosala, Malla, Vajji, Kāsi, Māgadha, and thus back, <span class="ref">SN.v.348</span> and he preached to the people, mostly in the Kūṭāgārasālā in Vesāli. Among other places besides Vesāli visited by the Buddha, are mentioned Ukkacela, Koṭigāma, Nādikā, Beluvagāma, Bhaṇḍagāma, Bhogagāma and Hatthigāma. Pubbavijjhana, the birthplace of Channa, is also mentioned as a village of the Vajjians. <span class="ref">SN.iv.59</span> The Vaggumudā river flowed through Vajjian territory. <span class="ref">Ud.iii.3</span></p><p>During the Buddha’s lifetime some monks of Vajji joined Devadatta. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.199<em>f.</em></span>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[A city, capital of the Licchavis. It is not possible to know how many visits were paid by the Buddha to Vesāli, but the books would lead us to infer that they were several. Various Vinaya rules are mentioned as having been laid down at Vesāli. <span class="ref">Vin.i.238</span><span class="ref">Vin.i.287<em>f.</em></span><span class="ref">Vin.ii.118</span><span class="ref">Vin.ii.119–127</span></p><p>It was during a stay in Vesāli, whither he had gone from Kapilavatthu, that Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī followed the Buddha with five hundred other Sākyan women, and, with the help of Ānanda’s intervention, obtained permission for women to enter the Order. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.253<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>The books describe <span class="ref">DN.ii.95<em>ff.</em></span> at some length the Buddha’s last visit to Vesāli on his way to Kusinārā. On the last day of this visit, after his meal, he went with Ānanda to Cāpāla cetiya for his siesta, and, in the course of their conversation, he spoke to Ānanda of the beauties of Vesāli: of the Udena cetiya, the Gotamaka cetiya, the Sattambaka cetiya, the Bahuputta cetiya, and the Sārandada cetiya. Other monasteries are also mentioned, in or near Vesāli e.g., Pātikārāma, Vālikārāma.</p><p>The Buddha generally stayed at the Kūṭāgārasālā during his visits to Vesāli, but it appears that he sometimes lived at these different shrines. <span class="ref">DN.ii.118</span> During his last visit to the Cāpāla cetiya he decided to die within three months, and informed Māra and, later, Ānanda, of his decision. The next day he left Vesāli for Bhaṇḍagāma, after taking one last look at the city, “turning his whole body round, like an elephant”. <span class="ref">DN.ii.122</span> The rainy season which preceded this, the Buddha spent at Beluvagāma, a suburb of Vesāli, while the monks stayed in and around Vesāli. On the day before he entered into the vassa, Ambapāli invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal, at the conclusion of which she gave her Ambavana for the use of the Order. <span class="ref">DN.ii.98</span></p><p>Among eminent followers of the Buddha who lived in Vesāli, special mention is made of Ugga, Piṅgiyāni, Kāraṇapālī, Sīha, Vāseṭṭha, <span class="ref">AN.iv.258</span> and the various Licchavis.</p><p>Vesāli was a stronghold of the Nigaṇṭhas. The Buddha’s presence in Vesāli was a source of discomfort to the Nigaṇṭhas, and we find mention of various devices resorted to by them to prevent their followers from coming under the influence of the Buddha.</p><p>At the time of the Buddha, Vesāli was a very large city, rich and prosperous, crowded with people and with abundant food. Its courtesan, Ambapālī, was famous for her beauty, and helped in large measure in making the city prosperous. <span class="ref">Vin.i.268</span></p><p>Outside the town was the Mahāvana, a large, natural forest. Near by were other forests, such as Gosiṅgalasāla. <span class="ref">AN.v.134</span></p><p>Among important suttas preached at Vesāli are the Mahāli, Mahāsīhanāda, Cūḷa Saccaka, Mahā Saccaka, Tevijja, Vacchagotta, Sunakkhatta and Ratana.</p><p>One hundred years after the Buddha’s death Vesāli was again the scene of interest for Buddhists, on account of the “Ten Points” raised by the Vajjiputtaka, and the second Council held in connection with this dispute at the Vālikārāma.</p><p>There were Nāgas living in Vesāli; these were called Vesālā. <span class="ref">DN.ii.258</span>]]></description>

The distance between the two places could be covered in one day, with seven relays of horses, <span class="ref">MN.i.149</span> but the books contain several references <span class="ref">Vin.i.88</span><span class="ref">Vin.i.89</span><span class="ref">Vin.i.270</span><span class="ref">Vin.iii.212</span><span class="ref">Vin.iv.63</span><span class="ref">Vin.iv.120</span> to the dangers of the journey when undertaken on foot. The road was infested with robbers, and the king had to maintain soldiers to protect travellers.</p><p>Midway between Sāketa and Sāvatthī was Toraṇavatthu, and it is said <span class="ref">SN.iv.374<em>ff.</em></span> that, when Pasenadi went from the capital to Sāketa, he spent a night in Toraṇavatthu, where be visited Khemā Therī who lived there. Between Sāketa and Sāvatthī was a broad river which could be crossed only by boat.<span class="ref">Vin.iv.65</span><span class="ref">Vin.iv.228</span> Near Sāketa was the Añjanavana, where the Buddha sometimes stayed during his visits to Sāketa and where he had several discussions e.g., with Kakudha, <span class="ref">SN.i.54</span> Mendasira, and Kuṇḍaliya. <span class="ref">SN.v.73</span></p><p>On other occasions he stayed at the Kāḷakārāma <span class="ref">AN.ii.24</span> gifted to the Order by Kāḷaka, and the Tikantakivana, <span class="ref">AN.iii.169</span> both of which were evidently near the city.

Bhaddākāpilāni <span class="ref">Vin.iv.292</span> also stayed there, so did Ānanda. Once when Ānanda was staying in the Migadāya in the Añjanavana, a nun, described as Jatilagāhikā, visited him and questioned him regarding concentration. <span class="ref">AN.iv.427</span> Among others who lived in Sāketa were Jambugāmikaputta, Gavampati, Mendasira, Uttara, Madhuvāsettha and his son Mahānāga, and Visākhā. Bhūta Thera was born in a suburb of Sāketa.</p><p>The Vinaya <span class="ref">Vin.i.270<em>f.</em></span> mentions another seṭṭhi of Sāketa. His wife had suffered for seven years from a disease of the head, and even skilled physicians failed to cure her. Jīvaka, on his way to Rājagaha, after finishing his studies in Takkasilā, visited Sāketa, heard of her illness, and offered to cure her. At first the seṭṭhi was sceptic, but in the end allowed Jīvaka to attend on his wife. Jīvaka cured her by the administration of ghee through the nose, and, as reward, received sixteen thousand <i>kahāpanas</i> from her and her various kinsmen.]]></description>
